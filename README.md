      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      

  <p>In this Projects, we will learn how to set up, configure, and secure DNS, Web, and SQL servers to run a web application like WordPress. We will use a Linux server on a cloud provider like Digital Ocean and acquire a domain name, "crystalmind.academy". We will install and configure BIND as the authoritative DNS server. Then, we will install Apache as the web server and PHP as the scripting language for the backend. MySQL will be used as the SQL server to store data. These software components together form the LAMP stack. Finally, we will install WordPress and secure it, which is essential. WordPress is the most widely used web application, with more than a third of all websites running on it. By the end of this project, we will have a running WordPress website, and we will have learned how to set up and manage a LAMP stack.</p>

     <h2>Running Server in Cloud</h2>
        
   <p>In this section we will set up a Linux server using a virtual private server (VPS) on Digital Ocean. We will create a droplet (Digital Ocean's term for a VPS), choosing an operating system and data center region, setting up SSH authentication, and connecting to the server using an SSH client.</p>
